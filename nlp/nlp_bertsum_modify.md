# BERTSUM_modify
## Problems
- labeling
- predict_combination
## Conceptions for improvement
- set-level classifier
- continuous label or loss
## Experiments
- traversing all permutation sets
- 0-1 labeling
- 0-1 sequence labeling
- rouge-score sequence labeling
- shuffle data with above experiments
## Problems reiteration
- label imbalance
- nonsense position attention
- risks more than rewards in the optimization
## Sensable solutions(AutoRegressive)
- memory mechanism in prediction
- tree-shape data set
## Schedule
- 2019-10-20 tree-shape data set
- 2019-10-24 train and test
- memory mechanism
