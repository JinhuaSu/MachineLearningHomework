# key point of review
## chap 8 ensemble learning

**key concept**

- hoeffding unequality
    + with a specific expression
    + using in estimate the maximum general error when ensembling different classifiers
- surrogate loss function
    + definition: a convex function
    + consistence
    + what will make the learner get the bayes best classification is called consistence
- different way to ensemble
    + boost
    + bagging
    + forest
