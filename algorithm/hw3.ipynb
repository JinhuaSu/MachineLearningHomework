    "It is an analogy question of cal-subquence. However there are 6 operations which relate with previous sub-problem, especially the twiddle operation and kill operation. As for different cost combination of above operation, the specific recurrence formulation may differ a bit, ignoring some extremely costful operation combinations to save time. For example, when the cost of delete is extremely bigger than the cost of delete, we will think about using delete to repalce the kill for most time."

So our final goal is to get the ED(x,n), where x ranges from 0 to m and is for updating OPT(KILL) in the termination, and we use bottom-top method to get close to ED(x,n) using ED(i,j) and recursive formulation.
