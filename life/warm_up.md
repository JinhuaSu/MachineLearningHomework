# warm up record

**target**

- everyday wake up my memory is so empty and my sensitive one can not really think about much and judge what should i do now, so I am supposed to write and continue to talk with my heart. Luckily it will make me more sober in the end.
- I don't want to be a walking dead born for working or other thing, and my ultimate goal is to live a elegant and efficient life where I can check my body state and decide which to do is best and bring me most happiness.
- Of course, use English to write will help improve my expression in so many useful working field.

**format**

For best situation, I may write a lot of garbage sentences to wake myself up but I will also write some sentences to remind me in the future. Hopefully I could get a fast glimpse at my five day working flow. And I also want to see the most enduring urge in a midterm, thus I could remenber it and do some lasting work for a long time perspective. I didn't want to do some clean or other trifles on it. So please keep a easy format all the time.

- week as chapter us double# and every weekday use M,T as a subpoint will be fine and a total week slogen and make me more sensitive of a week schedule.
- If i just write about some trifles or some pity or some not relevant thing, it may not work. So ask myself three thing: what i really like and want, how could I get close to it now, how much time spent on other not so important thing I can sacrife.

## Week 11

**week slogen**

Study makes one better in a field. But no one who didn.t study well can spend less time in reviewing and get a good grade.

**Tue**
- Today, my illness seems to be fine a lot. How could didn't loss anything. I need make a item management for myself. Know what should be done for sure and what indeed need to be what a status. Think about why i really like to cut the extra expence on the loss item. I never own it or have no concept for its importance so it has no itself work place, and make me so embarrased in looking for the items. Seem to get manage of all my items. What i need and what i don't need, where it should be and will there be convenient for me to reuse it.
- I like to have an elegant and efficient life. I like my study hard will be comfortable and precise. And I want my space is really pleasant for me. To make it more specific, I want my econometric review to have a wide and soft place to do the work.
- When working, do not move so frequently, and have some fixed place to work like in the black room. And make sure that I sit in a really good pose to make. If I finish for one time. Keep a time limit to improve my writing and calculating skill.
- what can i sacrife: my baoxiao and my JMC, how to do not go or have a standing review on the item: go and go back&do not go, do something indenpendence.

**Mon**
- I waked up with a tiring body because I slep late last night and I feel good because I had a busy and meaningful day. To conclude, one time focus on most important thing can make you feel concentrated, anxiety came from the change out of my expection, like afternoon test. However, emergence totally can be judged, as for some trifle just pushing it into manager will be OK. So today I want to have a elegant and meaningful day like yesterday.
- I like be a dream chaser and make a big deal without being so famous. Yes, I like my grade be good as possible as I can. Of course, in a long-term perspective, I'd like to win a futurous eduction and that will help me develop in my academic life.
- How to do them I have so many efficient way to keep my time in the really tough problem and make me develop faster. Keep 8-2 rule in mind, and have a more fit test schedule, the importance of ML is greater today because it relate master express. But I had better take a half day to make my econometric not so bad. Xi also deserve take a total day to make my writing and answer organization better, since it also relate my academic, yes if two have not enough time I is willing to study until I really want to sleep.

## Week 10

**week slogen**

I have no sense about the time and the task cost, so it is really necessary to make a dynamic to-do list application for me. Or the failure taste or unsensible time estimate may beat me again and again, finally i need to entertain myself in a unproper time or use awful entertainment material to entertain myself. Finally xmind is used just for how to tackle the subproblem which could be solved in a short time or other text work.

**Sun**
- Indeed it is a busy week, so many things get together and have a paradise. The best way to tackle problem is to make problem into subproblem and push it into a order sequence. Yes i really need this way, some time the problem will breed several unpredictable subproblem.
- I'd like to live a satisfatory and elegant and efficient life: have more efficient tool, become a engineer in the AI, become a score record keeper
- how maybe it just need to keep the data in the memory and make it possible and have a small demo. this will give me a confidence and power to do the other thing. AI paper may change my future so I should pay time to do it. The left time should to do the left thing and learning
- I can kill JMC time for i should to record the modify it&do not have my package and water exchange&fintech course&my unmature AI testing&if i am not hungry do not eat&do not have work out, just stand to work.
