# Econometrics
## how to learn ecnometrics faster and better
- judge these course's property
    + a not difficult course
    + have regular and large hw and standard answer provided by teacher
    + however it use a foreign reference book, it is a double-sided fact.
        - good: i can practise my English reading and be familiar with the syllabus and professional words
        - bad: it may be a bit hard to focus and keep patient with what teacher has said
    + finally i hope that i can be more confident in reading and write with English
- how much time I have for this lesson
    + indeed i could only promise the time for hw
    + I hope I can get the outline and key concept for econometrics
    + Luckily, I want to be more familiar with English writing
- how to do?
    + look through the reference book with a high speed and practise my kill of extracting knowledge
    + go to the question part and write with markdown
    + luckily, I can write a econometrics package for other users
    + warnning: use markdown may create lots of happiness and even urge myself on unnessary format and integrity. keep note on what I really need learn and find the interest and inspiration on the unknown.
- challenge
    + midtern test(11.19)
    + homework(every week)
    + final exam
## test point
- single-tail help for significance
- specification and full model how to explain it
## Chapter 1: Covariance, variance, and correlation
## Chapter 2: Simple regression anlysis
### key concept
- regression
    + origin: height of humans finally draws back
    + definition: a statistics relation of a unstochastis variable X and a stochastic variable Y, which contains the effect of noise. Usually we call the proceduce as regression Y on X. Explaining Y on X. 
    + explaination template for regression result:
        - a one-unit increase in X(measured in units of X) will cause a $b_{2}$ increase in Y(measured in units of Y).
        - check to see what the units if X and Y actually are, and to replace the word 'unit' with the actual unit of measurement.
        - see whether the result could be expressed in a better way, without altering its substance.
        - The constant, $b_{1}$, gives the predicted value of Y(in units of Y) for X equal to 0. It may or may not have a plausible meaning, depending on the context.
- Ordinary Least Square
### classical question

## Chapter 3: Properties of the regression coefficients and hypothesis testing
## Chapter 4: Multiple regression analysis
### key concept
- Interpretation of the Multiple Regression Coefficients
- Properties of the Multiple Regression Coefficients
    + efficiency
    + precision of the multiple regression coefficients
- multicollinearity
    + definition: in multiple regression, the correlation between the explanatory variables may lead to the larger population variance of the distributions of theit coefficients, thus with a greater risk of obtaining erratic estimates of the coefficients.
    + mathematical proof:
    + F Tests: $H_{0}:\beta_{k+1}=\beta_{k+2}=...=\beta_{m}=0$
## Chapter 5: transformation of variable
### key concept
- basic procedure
    + nonlinearity in the variables can always be sidestepped by using appropriate definitions
    + it is now linear in variables as well as in parameters
- Logarithmic Transformations
    + elasticity
    + something about how to get it.
